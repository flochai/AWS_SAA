Redshift is an OLAP column based, petabyte scale, data warehousing product that is used for long term analysis and trending. It is used in a similar way to RDS as a server and has a provisioning time which means it can't be used adhoc unlike [[Athena]].
It is not HA by design because it is tied to one AZ by design. 

OLAP ---> Analysis
OLTP ---> Transactions (real-time)
