Amazon Athena is a serverless querying service which allows for ad-hoc questions where billing is based on the amount of data consumed. It translates data on the fly from raw data to table using schema without modifying the original data from the S3 bucket. Many formats are supported. It is great for situations where you need to query data without loading it or transforming it.
