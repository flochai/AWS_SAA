DynamoDB is a NoSQL fully managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) product that can handle key/value pairs or documents. Unlike RDS & Aurora that are database **SERVERS**, DynamoDB is serverless which reduces admin overhead. It can scale automatically and is HA at a global level (optional extra). Because it is backed by SSDs, it is really fast.

One of the main advantages of DynamoDB is PITR (Point in Time Recovery) which needs to be enabled on a per table basis.

If we see NoSQL mentioned in the exam question, the default should be DynamoDB.
Dynamo rhymes with No(sql).
